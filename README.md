# manga-gamedle-clone

https://mangaguess.netlify.app/page.html

done:
 * finish colouring conditions for the other columns
 * lives system/limited number of guesses
 * one time random hint like in gamedle
 * automatically get data from other sites instead of hardcoding the dictionary (maybe) -> made a json with data automatically extracted from mu
 * more lives
 * show what the correct guess was


to do:
 * make this thing look pretty (never)
 * show cover?
 * synonyms for guessing
 * instead of alert just have the game over/you won on screen
 * pixelated cover? that gets clearer? like that movie guessing game with the reviews
 * unique daily guess
 * use your anilist/mal for the data maybe
